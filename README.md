# Air-BnB-Cape-Town
This project investigates the listings and property owners within AirBnb Cape Town. 

Included in this repository is the python code where I do a brief analysis of the listings and hosts in Cape Town. Thereafter, I focus on the top two hosts to determine which approach for investment is most appropriate based on rate per night and occupancy during December, a peak month for tourists in Cape Town.

To complete this analysis, there is a Tableau deck which summarises the above mentioned brief analysis of all listings and hosts in Cape Town, which allows for deeper inspection and wrangling of the data in a visualised manner.
